He could see the unmistakable aura of arcane magic surrounding the unassuming dwarf pretending to shop for wares. The warrior had found his target. As he drew his runic blade, what had appeared to be a dwarven peasant only mere seconds before had reverted to its true form. As the monstrous devil lunged forward, the hooded swordsman gripped his blade and prepared for battle.",

As the would-be assassin's blade darted toward the Duke's exposed neck, glee turned to fear as the heavily armored guardian appeared where theDuke had been moments ago. Before the killer could react to what had happened, a blade wreathed in emerald flame had pierced his chest, ending his wretched life of crime.",
						"The halfling knelt before the three hooded figures that stood before her. She had spent nearly two years of her life searching for a member of this secret order, and now she had found three. Consumed by sorrow after the loss of her father at the hands of a wicked sorcerer, the young halfling swore she would do whatever it took to gain the power to exact her revenge. Now that the moment was at hand, she swore fealty to the secretive order, offering up her life in return for power."
